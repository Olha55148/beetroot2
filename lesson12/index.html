                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                        components:

                        user interfaces with JavaScript.
                        To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you
                        started
                        or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bolt">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bolt">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX,
                        a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="background">< Text>Hello, I am your cat!</
                            Text>.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
                        JavaScript, you can use variables
                        inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, <span class="background">name,</span> and embedding it with curly braces
                        inside <span class="background">< Text></ Text></span>
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bolt">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bolt">+ state.</span>  While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                        state is like a component‚Äôs
                        personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
                        from user interaction.
                        State gives your components memory!

            </section>
            <section class="chapter4">
                <div class="header-chapter4">
                    <h1>HANDLING TEXT INPUT</h1>
                    <span>Chapter4</span>
                </div>
                <div class="text text-chapter4">
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span>
                         prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing
                          prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different 
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence 
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
                    </p>
